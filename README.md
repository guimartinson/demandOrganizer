# demandOrganizer
It reads data from CSV files, matches professionals with relevant demands, and allows various operations like displaying matched data, searching by ID, adding demands, and completing demands. The program uses Pandas for data manipulation and provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

Bugs
In the current implementation of the data matching process, there is a bug where some demands are being assigned to multiple professionals simultaneously. This issue impacts the accuracy of the matching algorithm and may lead to incorrect data representation.
